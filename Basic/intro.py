Variables and Data Types in Python
- Variables are used to store data values.
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
- Variable names can be any length and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.
